This is a small, very simple spaceship game that is being developed for educational purposes in Unity 6. So the construction will only be of the gameplay of the game, it will not be anything too elaborate with achievement systems or anything like that! But you are free to download it and continue with your studies. The project will cover gameplay with an Xbox controller.
